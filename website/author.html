<h2>The Author</h2>

<p>zsync is written by Colin Phipps, as is this website. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:cph&#64;moria.org.uk">cph&#64;moria.org.uk</a>. I retain the copyright to zsync, and make it available to you under the Artistic License v2 &#8212; see the file <code>COPYING</code> supplied with zsync.</p>
<p>I use IRC for my instant messaging, so you can find me from time to time on irc.freenode.net, #zsync.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>zsync uses <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/tech_report/"><i>the rsync algorithm</i></a>, from the technical paper by Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras.</p>

<p>zsync also contains some code from zlib, <code>Copyright (C) 1995-2003 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler</code>. I have made only slight alterations to this code, which I have put in the public domain.</p>

<p>zsync also includes checksum code taken from OpenBSD. The MD4 code is public
domanain, by Colin Plumb and Todd C. Miller. The SHA1 code is also public
domain, by Steve Reid. This code is in the libhash/ subdirectory, see the
individual files for their non-copyright notices.</p>

<p>I would like
to thank the Free Software Foundation and its contributors, for gcc, gdb and
emacs, the essential development tools. Also I would thank Sourceforge for
providing the hosting facilities for the downloads and mailing list, and the
compile farm for testing portability.
