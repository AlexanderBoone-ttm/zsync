<h2>What is zsync?</h2>

<p>zsync is a file transfer program. It allows you to download a file from a remote web server, where you have a copy of an older version of the file on your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts of the file. It uses the same algorithm as <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>.</p>

<p>zsync does not require any special server software or a shell account on the remote system (rsync, in comparison, requires that you have an rsh or ssh account, or that the remote system runs rsyncd). Instead, it uses a control file &#8212; a <code>.zsync</code> file &#8212; that describes the file to be downloaded and enables zsync to work out which blocks it needs. This file can be created by the admin of the web server hosting the download, and placed alongside the file to download &#8212; it is generated once, then any downloaders with zsync can use it. Alternatively, anyone can download the file, make a .zsync and provide it to other users (this is what I am doing for the moment).</p>

<p>zsync 0.0.2 is the current version. It is definitely no more than an alpha. I have tried to make it quite verbose, so it is clear what it is doing, and the checksum verification and file handling are designed to minimise the risk of it losing any data. It works well enough for me.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<h3>2004/10/30</h2>

<p>zsync 0.0.2 is out. Get it from the download page about. This is a major overhaul from 0.0.1, in particular removing the libc streams mess from the download process, and using HTTP/1.1+pipelining when downloading. This version can now max out my connection, and the traffic pattern is much more server-friendly. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=279107">Full changelog &amp; release notes</a>.</p>

<p>I am offering hourly-updated .zsync's for the main Debian Packages files (downloading these rather bulky files is a daily nuisance for Debian users). Feel free to use them:</p>
<pre>
zsync -i /var/lib/apt/lists/<i>server</i>.debian.org_debian_dists_sarge_main_binary-i386_Packages http://zsync.moria.org.uk/streams/sarge/Packages.zsync

zsync -i /var/lib/apt/lists/<i>server</i>.debian.org_debian_dists_unstable_main_binary-i386_Packages http://zsync.moria.org.uk/streams/unstable/Packages.zsync
</pre>

<p>I plan to put up .zsync's for some larger files too; Debian testing snapshot
ISOs, Fedora Core 3, ... I am open to suggestions. Local testing suggests that
0.0.2 copes with files of this size well enough, although it is currently slow
parsing the local data (~6 minutes to run the rsync stage on a 600meg ISO on my
oldish computer - but still very worthwhile, as it cut 40 minutes from the
download time over my DSL).</p>

<h2>Why did you write zsync? Why release it now?</h2>

<p>Release early, release often. I'm interested in hearing whether people think it is useful, and perhaps more interestingly what uses they think it should aim for. As a tool zsync only becomes useful as people begin to provide .zsync's for large downloads &#8212; which only happens if the tool is available and has users. In the meantime, I am interested in any feedback about the direction it is going in. I started zsync in the first week of October; perhaps in another month it will look totally different, but this depends on whether people think the current approach makes it useful.</p>

<p>I have put up <a href="paper/">this technical paper</a>, which sets out my current thinking on zsync. This is also at an early stage, so it's fairly sketchy on details, but does provide some reasoning and figures to back up the current approach.</p>
