.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Downloads a file over HTTP. zsync uses a control file to determine whether any blocks in the file are already known to the downloader, and only downloads the new blocks.
.LP 
Either a filename or a URL can be given on the command line \- this is the path of the \fBcontrol\fR file for the download, which normally has the name of the actual file to downlaod with .zsync appended. (To create this .zsync file you have to have a copy of the target file, so this file should be generated by the person providing the download).
.LP 
zsync downloads to your current directory. It looks for any file in the directory of the same name as the file to download. If it finds one, it assumes that this is an earlier or incomplete version of the new file to download, and scans this file for any blocks that it can use to build the target file. (It also looks for a file of the same name with .part appended, so it will automatically find previously interrupted zsync downloads and reuse the data already downloaded. If you know that the local file to use as input has a different name, you must use \fB\-i\fR)
.LP 
zsync retrieves the rest of the target file over HTTP. Once the download is finished, the old version (if the new file wants the same name) is moved aside (a .zs\-old extension is appended).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
.TP 
\fB\-i\fR \fIinputfile\fP
Specifies (extra) input files. \fIinputfile\fP is scanned to identify blocks in common with the target file and zsync uses any blocks found. Can be used multiple times.
.TP 
\fB\-o\fR \fIoutputfile\fP
Override the default output file name.
.TP 
\fB\-V\fR
Prints the version of zsync.
